# Team No Label: Self-Supervised Learning for Visual Representations

Learning visual representations from unlabeled images using self-supervised learning (SSL) with models under 100M parameters.

## Overview
This repository contains code and experiments for designing and implementing self-supervised learning methods to extract meaningful visual features from large unlabeled image datasets. The project focuses on exploring algorithms, architectures, losses, augmentations, and optimization strategies from scratch.
